DocGraph
========

The data release system for DocGraph, the doctor referral social graph

This is a <a href='http://notonlyfor.com'>Not Only Development</a> project.

Licenses
========

Each subdirectory of this project has a seperate license file (so that we can have different dates for when things go open. There are three types of licenses to this data, based on what you paid for.

First, there is the Open Source Eventually license. This license details the terms of the data license until the license reverts to the Open Source license. Remember that different sets of data will become open at different times, there are dates in this License file that are very important. Please pay attention to them and honor them. As long as the date contained in this file is in the future, then it applies. 

Second, there are the Open Source licenses themselves. Specifically, the Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported (CC BY-SA 3.0) unless otherwise noted. If we license software we will use a different license, so this might change.

Third, there is a proprietary friendly license, for those who bought this. Remember, that this license applies -only- if you paid for it. 

Data
========
This section will dictate what data has been gotten and where it lives in the repository. The first thing to be released will be the 2011 referral data set. All of the other data sets will become available as we gather them.
