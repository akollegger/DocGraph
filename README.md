DocGraph Data
========

The data release system for DocGraph, the doctor social graph

This is a <a href='http://notonlyfor.com'>Not Only Development</a> and <a href='http://docgraph.org'>DocGraph Journal</a> project.

DocGraph Software
========

In order to make the DocGraph system more usable, we are releasing some tools that serve to simplify the node database (linked below).
This code will take the complex node structure from the NPPES and simplify it usefully. 


If you would like to use this tool, clone the repo to your local drive with php-cli available... and then run the command

 php simple_npi.php npidata_20130513-20130519.csv out.csv

The first argument is the link the NPPES node download. The second file is the resulting simple node database.
note that your npidata file will have differnt dates...
